# Pointer Arithmetic Error in C This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming related to pointer arithmetic. The `bug.c` file contains code with an error, and the `bugSolution.c` file provides a corrected version. The error involves incorrect modification of integer variables via pointers, a frequent source of unexpected behavior and crashes. The solution highlights safe and correct ways to manipulate data through pointers in C.
